\section{Conclusions and Future Work \label{sec:conclusionsAndOutlook}}

We presented in this paper a DSL supporting the model 
constructs required by the URDAD methodology. The URDAD 
DSL is substantially simpler than UML and the meta model 
has been shown to be consistent. URDAD DSL models support 
traceability and have notably reduced design complexity. 
We were able to specify a textual grammar and generate 
useful language-aware editors and parsers for the
practitioner.

\todo{In next paragraph highlight suitability for services oriented approach and non-suitability for event-centric systems}
Currently the URDAD methodology and DSL represent a 
services-oriented approach that is not very suitable 
for event-centric or embedded systems. Moreover, the 
current textual syntax still too technical for many
industrial practitioners. A critical aspect for the 
success of the URDAD DSL is the definition of a usable 
graphical syntax and the development of corresponding 
modelling tools which makes the language more accessible
for industrial practitioners. Such tool-support is 
currently in development. Once this has been done, 
we plan to conduct an empirical usability and productivity 
assessment of the URDAD DSL (compared to an URDAD UML) 
approach. The derivation of test cases from URDAD DSL
specifications is also planned.
