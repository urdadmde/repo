\section{Conclusions and outlook \label{sec:conclusionsAndOutlook}}

lower model complexity and more rigorous semantics useful for code and test generation

URDAD = methodology for services oriented analysis and design - this introduces limitations around events, flexibility, choreography, ...., cooperative agents

There is a lot of future work to be done. A critical aspect for the success of the URDAD-DSL is the definition of a usable graphical syntax and the development of corresponding modeling tools which makes the URDAD-DSL accessible to domain experts. Once this has been done one can perform an empirical usability assessment of the URDAD-DSL by having two groups of domain experts with similar skills levels doing URDAD modeling, one using UML encoding and UML tools and one using URDAD encoding. One can then assess the relative productivity of the two groups and the error densities and completeness of the UML and URDAD-DSL encoded URDAD models.
