Use-Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design (URDAD) is a services-oriented analysis and design methodology used by domain experts to develop technology-neutral, semi-formal analysis and design models representing the PIM within OMG's MDA. Historically, these models were encoded in UML. However, capturing the concepts required by URDAD in UML demands a high level of effort, skill and discipline from domain experts and results in high model inconsistency risks. This paper introduces and assesses a domain-specific language (DSL) for URDAD. The URDAD metamodel is shown to be consistent and satisfiable. We demonstrate that models represented in the URDAD-DSL have significantly lower language and model complexity than corresponding UML models and that they support implementation mapping and test generation. Model validation for completeness and consistency, requirements traceability and URDAD tool development are simplified. We also present a concrete text syntax for URDAD.
