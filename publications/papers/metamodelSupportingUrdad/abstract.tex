\abstract{
The Use-Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design (URDAD) is a services-oriented analysis and design method for domain experts to develop semi-formal requirements and technology-neutral design models. Historically, these models were encoded in UML. However, capturing the concepts required by the URDAD method in UML requires a high level of effort, skill and discipline. This includes tedious tasks around manually inserting the model relationships required by URDAD, and a high risk of model inconsistency. Furthermore, encoding services contracts with sufficient information for test generation has proven to be difficult using UML and OCL. This paper introduces a domain-specific language (DSL) supporting the URDAD method. We present and assess the URDAD metamodel (URDAD-DSL), instances of which can be used as Platform-Independent Models in Model-Driven Engineering. The metamodel expresses stakeholder requirements in the form of services contracts and technology neutral process designs. We demonstrate that it supports implementation mapping and test generation. URDAD-DSL-based models have significantly lower language and model complexity than corresponding UML models. Model validation for completeness and consistency as well as URDAD tool development are simplified. We also present a simple concrete textual syntax for capturing an URDAD model.
