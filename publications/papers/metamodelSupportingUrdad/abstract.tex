\abstract{
The Use-Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design (URDAD) is a services-oriented analysis and design method used by domain experts to develop semi-formal requirements and technology neutral design models. Historically these models were encoded in UML. However, capturing the concepts required by the URDAD method in UML requires a high level of effort, skill and discipline. It includes tedious tasks around inserting semantic relationships required by URDAD and results in significant inconsistency risks. Furthermore, encoding services contracts with sufficient information for test generation is difficult using UML and OCL. This paper introduces a domain-specific language (DSL) supporting the URDAD. We present and assess an URDAD metamodel supporting implementation mappings and test generation. URDAD-DSL based model encodings have significantly lower language and model complexity than corresponding UML encodings. Model validation for completeness and consistency as well as URDAD tool development are simplified.  We also present a simple concrete text syntax for capturing an URDAD model.
