\abstract{
URDAD is a methodology which is used by domain experts to develop semi-formal requirements and technology neutral design models. Historically these models were encoded in UML. However, capturing the concepts required by the URDAD process in UML requires a high level of effort, skill and discipline. It includes tedious tasks around inserting semantic relationships required by the URDAD method and results in significant inconsistency risks. This paper introduces a domain-specific language supporting the URDAD methodology. We present and assess an URDAD metamodel supporting implementation mappings and test generation. URDAD-DSL based model encodings have significantly lower language and model complexity than corresponding UML encodings. Model validation for completeness and consistency as well as URDAD tool development are simplified. We also present a simple concrete text syntax for capturing an URDAD model.
