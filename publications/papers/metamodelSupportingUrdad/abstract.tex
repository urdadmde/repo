\abstract{
URDAD is a methodology which is used by requirements engineering to develop semi-formal requirements and technology neutral design models. Historically these models were encoded in UML. However, capturing the concepts required by the URDAD process in UML requires a high level of effort, skill and discipline. It includes tedious tasks around inserting certain semantic relationships required by the URDAD method and carries significant inconsistency risks. This paper introduces a domain-specific language supporting the URDAD methodology. We present and assess an URDAD metamodel which supports URDAD model encodings with significantly lower language and model complexity than a UML encoding using an URDAD  profile. Model validation for completeness and consistency as well as URDAD tool development are simplified. We also present a simple concrete text syntax which capture an URDAD model conforming to the metamodel in a normalized way.
