\section{Assessing the URDAD metamodel}

in this section we
\begin{itemize}
  \item Check that no classes unsatisfiable
  \item Check consistency of OCL constraints
\end{itemize}

    * Consistency checking of meta-model itself (perhaps in the OWL-DL space)
    * Model instance validation
          o Process addresses all functional requirements and nothing but the functional requirements
          o Completeness verification (All required OCL constraints specified, e.g. those to populate request & result objects, conditionals on process, ...) 
    * At both, metamodel and and model level we enforce
          o no logical inconsistencies
          o no redundancies 
    * State that we have checked the following for the metamodel 

Evaluating UML vs DSL model enconding

    * Evaluate relative model complexities (UML model requires much more model elements to encode URDAD semantics)
    * Consider doing an empirical study
          o Have a group use UML with UML tool and another the URDAD DSL.
          o Compare productivity and quality of outcomes.
