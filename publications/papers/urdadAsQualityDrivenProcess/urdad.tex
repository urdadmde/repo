\section{URDAD}
\label{sec:urdad}

In this section we will introduce URDAD from the perspective of a quality driven process generating an analysis and design model which enforces certain model and process qualities.  URDAD\cite{solms_generating_2009} provides a service oriented analysis and design methodology, a metamodel defining the semantics and structure of an URDAD model, and a domain specific language (the \emph{URDAD-DSL}) with a concrete text grammar which can be used to construct an URDAD model. A graphical grammar and diagram-based tooling around that grammar are under development.
