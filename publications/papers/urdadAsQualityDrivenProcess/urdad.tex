\section{URDAD}
\label{sec:urdad}

In this section we will introduce URDAD from the perspective of a quality driven process generating an analysis and design model which enforces certain model and process qualities.  URDAD\cite{solms_generating_2009} provides a service oriented analysis and design methodology, a metamodel introducing the semantics (modeling constructs) for an URDAD based domain specific language (the \emph{URDAD-DSL}), as well as a concrete text grammar which can be used to populate an URDAD model complying to the metamodel. A graphical grammar and diagram-based tooling around that grammar are under development.
