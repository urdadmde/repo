\section{Model quality}

Emphasize that model a functional model, bot addressing non-functional (quality requirements) of system

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{testability} measured as fraction of non-testable requirements.
  \item \emph{traceability} measured as fraction of requirements which are not related to the stake holder who requires them, fraction of activities which are not traceable to the functional requirement they aim to address, 
  \item \emph{complexity} based on number and complexity of services with complexity of service necessarily related to Mcabe (cyclomatic) complexity - not sure that URDAD addresses this.
  \item \emph{cohesion} - will be interesting to try and find a measure for cohesion in the service oriented world.
  \item \emph{reuse} - number of
  \item \emph{coupling} - URDAD enforces decoupling across levels of granularity in both, the process and the metamodel.
\end{itemize}
