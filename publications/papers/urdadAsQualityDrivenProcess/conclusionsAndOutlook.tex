\section{Conclusions and outlook}

In this paper we identified the stakeholders in the analysis and design methodology and the resultant requirements and technology neutral process design model and their quality requirements. We related these quality requirements to quality drivers and measures which can be applied within a services-oriented approach. We then identified that subset of quality drivers which has been embedded within the URDAD process and pointed out how some of these are enforced by the URDAD metamodel.

Future work includes the specification of a graphical grammar making the domain specific language for URDAD accessible to requirements engineers like business analysts and the specification and development of quality assessment tools which can be used to either report quality measures or provide real time quality guidelines to modelers.
