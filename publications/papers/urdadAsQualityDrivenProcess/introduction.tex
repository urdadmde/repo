\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

The Oxford dictionary defines quality as `the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind' or the `degree of excellence of something'. The concept of quality is intrinsically subjective - hence we have the saying that `quality is in the eye of the beholder'. For the purpose of this paper we define quality is a measure to which a solution fulfills the requirements \cite{lange_managing_2005,lange_improving_2006}. Such a definition requires the specification of quality requirements prior to be able to assess quality. Even though quality requirements represent a different concept to functional requirements, the degree of fullfillment of the functional requirements can itself be seen as an aspect of quality. This is, however, just one aspect of quality. Even though a solution might be functional, it might not be regarded of high quality as is evident with some of the greatest building architectures many of which are not very functional.

In the context of an analysis and design methodology one needs to consider both, the quality of the methodology or process as well as the quality of the resulting analysis and design model. It is questionable whether a process which yields low model quality can itself be viewed of high quality as the purpose of the process is to generate the model. On the other hand, one may have different processes which yield similar model qualities but with very different process qualities. 

In order to assess quality, we need to measure it. This paper will introduce quality measures for the design
