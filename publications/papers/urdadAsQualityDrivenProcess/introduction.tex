\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

Inferior requirements quality remains a core contributor to software quality\cite{heck_experiences_2008,_strategies_2011}. Furthermore, early defect detection is critical for cost containment\cite{betterRefernceThanBoehm1981WhichReliesOnWaterfall}. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) in particular aim to address this by making the models the primary artifacts which are to be developerd by requirements engineers who have solid domain knowledge and not by technical experts. The platform independent model is enriched with architecture and technology information an the system artifacts (e.g.\ code) are generated either manually by developers or in an automated way using model-transformation and code generation technologies. In an MDA-based approach quality improvement is focused on improving the requirements model and architecture specification as well as the transformation components used to generate the system artifacts.

Quality is often a subjective measure and is dependent on the quality measures. For the purpose of this paper we 

URDAD (Use-Case, Responsibility Dirven Analysis and Design) \cite{solms_technology_2007} is a methodology which generates MDA's PIM \cite{solms_generating_2009}. It is a semi-formal \cite{solms_urdad_2010} approach to technology-neutral analysis and design which we are in the process of making incrementally more formal. Historically URDAD models were encoded in UML, but in order to reduce the complexity, tighten up the semantics and enforce certain model qualities through a rigid model structure, we have developed a domain specific language (DSL) for URDAD with a defined metamodel with a concrete text syntax \cite{solmsfritz_domain-specific_????}..

\emph{This might be a little controversial:} URDAD provides an environment (an architecture) to perform the analysis and design. Like any architecture, it needs to provide a suitable infrastructure to support the quality attributes for the processes which are deployed in the architecture \cite{}, i.e.\ the architecture needs to be designed in order to address the quality requirements. The infrastructure includes the process definition for services oriented analysis and design as well as a metamodel enforcing the structure of the resultant analysis and design model.


In this paper we look look at URDAD from the perspective of both, process and model quality. We identify the stake holders and their quality requirements. For each quality requirement we identify quality drivers and analyze whether and how these quality drivers are embedded within the URDAD process. Finally we aim to identify a set of model quality measures and assess an URDAD model against these.



URDAD collapses CIM and PIM

\cite{lange_managing_2005,lange_improving_2006}.


In the context of an analysis and design methodology one needs to consider both, the quality of the methodology or process as well as the quality of the resulting analysis and design model. It is questionable whether a process which yields low model quality can itself be viewed of high quality as the purpose of the process is to generate the model. On the other hand, one may have different processes which yield similar model qualities but with very different process qualities. 

In order to assess quality, we need to measure it. This paper will introduce quality measures for the design

Refer to \cite{wirfs-brock_object-oriented_1989}

One of the core challanges is to have requirements specialists make the paradigm shift to specify requirements in terms of services contracts for reusable services\cite{haines_impact_2007}. In practice we have found that URDAD assists significantly on that front.



Quality requirements for process  by infrastructure within which process executed, model qualities driven out by model infrastructure (metamodel) and system qualities ultimately by system architecture

process assists in improving quality of requirements by forcing certain questions

because requirements and design are arch and techn neutral, stakeholders (business) can understand them and validate them, improving quality

urdad as a semi formal method aims for full testability and partial validatability.

Formal methods complex, expensive, high skills, inflexible. Could be applied to certain critical services.

 
Yes, URDAD provides an architecture (infrastructure) for doing the analysis and design work - hence it addresses quality requirements. Any architecture needs to be quality driven
