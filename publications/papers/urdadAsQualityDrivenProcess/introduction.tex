\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

The Oxford dictionary defines quality as `the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind' or the `degree of excellence of something'. The concept of quality is intrinsically subjective - hence we have the saying that `quality is in the eye of the beholder'. For the purpose of this paper we define quality is a measure to which a solution fulfills the stakeholder functional and non-functional (quality) requirements\cite{}. However, the degree to which a system fulfills its functional requirements is also an aspect of quality.  \cite{lange_managing_2005,lange_improving_2006}.


In the context of an analysis and design methodology one needs to consider both, the quality of the methodology or process as well as the quality of the resulting analysis and design model. It is questionable whether a process which yields low model quality can itself be viewed of high quality as the purpose of the process is to generate the model. On the other hand, one may have different processes which yield similar model qualities but with very different process qualities. 

In order to assess quality, we need to measure it. This paper will introduce quality measures for the design



Quality requirements for process  by infrastructure within which process executed, model qualities driven out by model infrastructure (metamodel) and system qualities ultimately by system architecture

process assists in improving quality of requirements by forcing certain questions

because requirements and design are arch and techn neutral, stakeholders (business) can understand them and validate them, improving quality

urdad as a semi formal method aims for full testability and partial validatability.

Formal methods complex, expensive, high skills, inflexible. Could be applied to certain critical services.
