  URDAD, the \emph{Use-Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design} is a service-oriented methodology used by requirements engineers to produce the Computation Independent Models (CIMs) of the \emph{Model Driven Architecture} (MDA) with sufficient detail and precision that they can be used directly as \emph{Platform Independent Models} (PIMs). The analysis and design process is supported by a metamodel specifying the modeling semantics and a concrete grammar used to capture URDAD models. In this paper we identify quality criteria for the resultant requirements specification and for the process itself. For each quality criterion we identify a set of quality drivers and show how quality drivers are embedded within the URDAD methodology.
