  URDAD, the \emph{Use-Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design} is a services-oriented methodology used by requirements engineers to generate the Computation Independent Models (CIMs) of the \emph{Model Driven Architecture} (MDA) with sufficient detail and preciseness to be directly used as \emph{Platform Independent Models} (PIMs). The analysis and design process is sported by a metamodel specifying the modeling semantics and a concrete grammar used to capture URDAD models. In this paper we identify the quality requirements for the resultant requirements model and for the process itself. For each quality requirement we identify a set of quality drivers and show how many of these quality drivers are embedded within the URDAD methodology. Finally we demonstrate the internal consistency of URDAD process by showing how URDAD can be used to generate itself.
