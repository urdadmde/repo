  URDAD, the \emph{Use-Case, Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design} methodology is used by requirements engineers to specify services oriented, technology neutral requirements specifications and process designs. The methodology provides an analysis and design process which is suported my a metamodel specifying the modeling semantics and a concrete grammar facilitating the capturing of a model complying to the URDAD metamodel. In this paper we identify the stakeholders in the analysis and design process and the resultant model and their associated quality requirements. For each quality attribute we identify quality drivers and quality measures. We show how many of the quality drivers have been embedded within the URDAD methdology.
