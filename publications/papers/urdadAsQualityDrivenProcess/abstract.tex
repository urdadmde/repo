 In this paper we discuss how the URDAD process was specifically formulated to `drive' out and enforce certain quality requirements. We analyse quality requirements of both, the analysis and design process and the resultant models from the perspective of the respective stakeholders. The paper discusses model quality measures and applies them to an URDAD model.
