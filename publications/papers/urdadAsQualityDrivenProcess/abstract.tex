URDAD, the \emph{Use-Case, Responsibility-Driven Analysis and Design} is a services-oriented methodology used by requirements engineers to generate a technology and computation independent requirements process design model. This model is meant to provide the \emph{Computation Independent Model} (CIM) of the \emph{Model-Driven Architecture} (MDA) with sufficient detail and preciseness to be directly used as \emph{Platform Independent Model} (PIM). The methodology provides an analysis and design process which is supported by a metamodel specifying the modelling semantics and a concrete grammar facilitating the capturing of a model complying with the URDAD metamodel. In this paper we identify the stakeholders in the analysis and design process and the resultant model and their associated quality requirements. For each quality attribute we identify quality-drivers and quality measures. We show how many of the quality-drivers have been embedded within the URDAD methodology.
