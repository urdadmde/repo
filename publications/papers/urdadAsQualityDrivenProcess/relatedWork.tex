Philip Mayer, Andreas Schroeder and Nora Koch\cite{mayer_mdd4soa:_2008} define a UML4SOA profile which is mean to support model-driven service orchestration in UML as well as a MDD4SOA approach which has specifies a service orchestration methodology using the UML4SOA profile. They target directly SOA implementation and hence do not aim to be technology and architecture neutral. URDAD, on the other hand, provides a services-oriented analysis and desig methodology in the context of MDA with potentially different implementation mappings for layered enterprise architures, services-oriented or event-driven architectures, legacy systems or even manual processes. Their main concern is to provide a natural and sufficient environment to generate BPEL processes and WSDL contracts and do not directly consider model or process quality requirements and drivers.
