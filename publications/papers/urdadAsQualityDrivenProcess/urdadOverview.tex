\section{Overview of URDAD}

\subsection{Quality drivers of URDAD}

Discuss first the methodology, then the metamodel with example encodings in concrete text syntax.

Include step for quantifying each quality requirement and list quantification measures

Refer to \cite{gonzalez_unity_2009} to use unity criteria to define responsibility domain boundaries.
\todo{Fritz:Look at unity models as in Espana et al and see progress report for responsibility localization and general short-comings in use case based approach regarding this.}

Refer to \cite{wirfs-brock_object-oriented_1989}

One of the core challanges is to have requirements specialists make the paradigm shift to specify requirements in terms of services contracts for reusable services\cite{haines_impact_2007}. In practice we have found that URDAD assists significantly on that front.
