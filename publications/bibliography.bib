	abstract = {This paper describes a graph-theoretic complexity measure and illustrates how it can be used to manage and control program complexity. The paper first explains how the graph theory concepts apply and gives an intuitive explanation of the graph concepts in programming terms. The control graphs of several actual {FORTRAN} programs are then presented to illustrate the correlation between intuitive complexity and the graph theoretic complexity. Several properties of the graph-theoretic complexity are then proved which show, for example, that complexity is independent of physical size (adding or subtracting functional statements leaves complexity unchanged) and complexity depends only on the decision structure of a program. The issue of using non-structured control flow is also discussed. A characterization of non-structured control graphs is given and a method of measuring the “structuredness” of a program is developed. The relationship between structure and reducibility is illustrated with several examples. The last section of the paper deals with a testing methodology used in conjunction with the complexity measure; a testing strategy is defined that dictates that a program can either admit of a certain minimal testing level or the program can be structurally reduced.},

More specifically, next to providing a classification framework for business rules and investigating the existing standards and languages for the formal specification of business rules, we propose a model-driven framework for the rule-based design of services. We provide an example to illustrate this framework and to demonstrate the role business rules can play in the context of {MDD} of {SOAs.} Furthermore, we also explore, in terms of existing tool support, the extent to which, the model-driven design process can be complemented and combined with business rules written in nearly natural language, which can become, at the platform specific level, an executable way to specify business knowledge and decisions.}},

In this paper we propose a rule driven approach for adaptive business collaboration development in which rules drive and govern the development process. We firstly introduce the business collaboration context framework {(BCCF)}, which provides enterprises with the context required for business collaboration. We then explain our model driven approach with which enterprises can capture this context in business collaboration models. Subsequently we demonstrate how we utilize rules to drive the development and management of such models, as such facilitating flexible and adaptive business collaboration},

	abstract = {Over the last several years, metamodels and ontologies have been developed in parallel isolation. Ontological thinking, largely from the research field of artificial intelligence, has been increasingly investigated by software engineering researchers, more familiar with the idea of a metamodel. Here, we investigate the literature on both metamodelling and ontologies in order to identify ways in which they can be made compatible and linked in such a way as to benefit both communities and create a contribution to a coherent underpinning theory for software engineering. Analysis of a large number of theoretical and semi-theoretical approaches using as a framework a multi-level modelling construct identifies strengths, weaknesses, incompatibilities and inconsistencies within the extant literature. A metamodel deals with conceptual definitions while an ontology deals with real-world descriptors of business entities and is thus better named "domain ontology". A specific kind of ontology (foundational or high-level) provides "metalevel" concepts for the domain ontologies. In other words, a foundational ontology may be used at the same abstraction level as a metamodel and a domain ontology at the same abstraction level as a (design) model, with each pair linked via an appropriate semantic mapping.},

	abstract = {Compliance between a problem and a solution domain(s) is a well-known issue in software development. A usual way of development is focusing on the solution, and adapting the solution to the problem domain only in case of occurred issues. Sometimes, the cost of such adaptation is very high, and then the cheapest way is to change operation of the problem domain. Certainly, such ways cannot satisfy a client. This paper considers a computation independent model as a place where overcoming of the gap must occur. It discusses ways for overcoming a gap between a problem domain and a solution domain(s) that are proposed within {CIMs}, and suggests a mathematical mechanism, continuous mapping, provided by a topological functioning model together with its other topological and functional properties as a formal bridge between those domains. This mechanism is explained by an example.},

To support the design and implementation of text editing facilities many concrete syntax and model mapping tools have emerged. Despite the maturity of these tools, users still spend considerable effort to specify syntaxes and generate editors even for simple metamodels. To reduce this effort, we propose to refine a specification that is automatically derived from a given metamodel. We argue that defaults in a customisable setting enable developers to quickly realise text-based editors for models. In particular in settings where metamodels evolve, such a procedure is beneficial. To evaluate this idea we present {EMFText} [1], an {EMF/Eclipse} integrated tool for agile Textual Syntax {(TS)} development. We show how default syntax can easily be tailored and refined to obtain a custom text editor for {EMF} models and demonstrate our approach by two examples.},

These complexity attributes can be defined in terms of functions of the number of {I/O} variables and fanout of the modules comprising the design. A complexity indicator based on these measures showed good agreement with a subjective assessment of design quality but even better agreement with an objective measure of software error rate. Although based on a study of only eight medium-scale scientific projects, the data strongly support the value of the proposed complexity measure in this context. Furthermore, graphic representations of the software designs demonstrate structural differences corresponding to the results of the numerical complexity analysis. The proposed complexity indicator seems likely to be a useful tool for evaluating design quality before committing the design to code.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	volume = {11},
	issn = {1092-0617},
	abstract = {{Service-Oriented} Architectures {(SOA)} provide the first widely applicable approach to tying together diverse "stovepipe" (or "silo") systems. They are, therefore, a "pure" example of how to build Systems of Systems {(SOS).} With the growing interest in and increasing number of implementations of {SOAs}, there is a pressing need for measures and metrics that can help {SOA} developers {(Chief} Architects or Program Managers) in predicting potential problems in the development/evolution of their {SOA} system. For {SOA-based} systems, such assistance is vital since their success depends on melding appropriate technologies and design with organizational characteristics, customer profiles, and functions provided, a Systems of Systems {(SOS)} concern. This paper discusses an ongoing effort in this area. In addition to providing a useful tool, this effort is technically significant for three key reasons. First, {SOA} specification and assessment requires consideration of technology factors and their relationships to the organization, and to individual information consumers. Essentially, these are related to metrics for systems engineering. Second, requirements (e.g., ease of use, flexibility) are defined in terms of system characteristics that can be modeled and measured. Thus, the system is defined by a set of evolving models and metrics that allow continual evaluation of progress towards eliminating problems. Third, since requirements are initially expressed with coarse-grained conceptual models, measurement of the characteristics of these models can indicate areas where the system might not meet some requirement, thereby allowing early corrective action. Thereafter, more refined models, can be developed to track the success of corrective actions. This paper provides a background on {SOA}, challenges for {SOA} metrics, and proposes a model-based metrics framework for evaluating {SOAbased} systems on an ongoing basis. It provides exemplar metrics and measures for {SOA}, and discusses several approaches to metrics quantification and presentation.},

Mistakes and omissions in requirements documents lead to ambiguous or wrong interpretation by engineers and, in turn, cause errors that trickle down in design and implementation with consequences on the overall development cost. In this paper we describe a methodology for requirements specification that aims to alleviate the above issues and that produces models for functional requirements that can be automatically validated for completeness and consistency. This methodology is part of the Requirements Driven Design Automation framework {(RDDA)} that we develop for component-based system development. The {RDDA} framework uses an ontology-based language for semantic description of functional product requirements, {UM-} {L/SysML} structure diagrams, component constraints, and Quality of Service. The front end method for requirements specification is the {SysML} editor in Rhapsody. A requirements model in {OWL} is converted from {SysML} {XMI} representation. The specification is validated for completeness and consistency with a ruled-based system implemented in Prolog. With our methodology, omissions and several types of consistency errors present in the requirements specification are detected early on, before the design stage.},

	abstract = {A key ingredient in system and organization modeling is modeling business processes that involve the collaborative participation of different teams within and outside the organization. Recently, the use of the Unified Modeling Language {(UML)} for collaborative business modeling has been increasing, thanks to its human-friendly visual representation of a rich set of structural and behavioral views, albeit its unclear semantics. In the meantime, the use of the Web Ontology Language {(OWL)} has also been emerging, thanks to its clearly-defined semantics, hence being amenable to automatic analysis and reasoning, although it is less human friendly than, and also perhaps not as rich as, the {UML} notation -- especially concerning processes, or activities. In this paper, we view the {UML} and the {OWL} as being complementary to each other, and exploit their relative strengths. We provide a mapping between the two, through a set of mapping rules, which allow for the capture of {UML} activity diagrams in an {OWL-ontology.} This mapping, which results in a formalization of collaborative processes, also sets a basis for subsequent construction of executable models using the Colored Petri Nets {(CPN)} formalism. For this purpose, we also provide appropriate mappings from {OWL-based} ontological elements into {CPN} elements. A case study of a mortgage granting system is described, along with the potential benefits and limitations of our proposal.},

	abstract = {Originally, meta-models were used to specify the structure (abstract syntax) of modelling languages. This is reflected both in meta-languages like {MOF} and Ecore, and the four-layer meta-model architecture. Presently, meta-modelling is used for specification of complete languages. In this situation, it turns out that the traditional meta-languages are not always expressive enough to capture all language aspects. This usually implies the use of more than one metalanguage in the meta-model architecture to cover the different language aspects. There are many approaches to address this challenge. In this paper, we analyze these approaches, and based on this analysis, we re-think the meta-model architecture focusing on complete language specifications. In our meta-model architecture, each aspect of a language conforms to an aspect-specific meta-language at the level above, and models can reside at different levels depending on their context and use. This meta-model architecture is easier to understand, more flexible and more extensible; therefore it may be useful in the design of meta-model-based language specification platforms, as well as for promoting the understanding of the principles of meta-modelling.},

	abstract = {In the Software Engineering practice, software requirements are one of the earliest artifacts describing a system. Without requirements we cannot verify the quality of a delivered software product. Requirements are mostly textual descriptions. Traceability is considered essential to manage consistency between software development artifacts. Many research focused on the relation between requirements and other artifacts such as design, code and test cases. However, less attention has been paid to the relation between requirements. Goknil et al proposed a requirementsmetamodel. This provides structure to requirements models. This metamodel is distilled from key entities from several requirements engineering approaches described in literature. The main focus of the requirements metamodel is on requirements relations and their types. Furthermore, they provided formal semantics of the requirements relations in first-order logic. This enables reasoning on requirements and consistency checking. To provide a proof of concept for the metamodeling approach proposed by G?oknil et al. we need an environment to model requirements conforming to the requirements metamodel. And we need a tool that supports first-order logic reasoning over requirements relations. To the best of our knowledge, no requirements management tools exists which are capable of reasoning about requirements relations using formal semantics. Therefore, we developed a tool named {TRIC} {(Tool} for Requirements Inference and Consistency checking). {TRIC} is developed as an Eclipse {RCP} application. Requirements models are expressed in the Web Ontology Language {(OWL)}, because first-order logic reasoners for {OWL} exist. Requirements models are stored and retrieved in {RDFS/XML} notation, enabling interoperability. To establish inference of implicit relations and to enable consistency checking we created a mapping between the formalization of requirements relations to {OWL} syntax and reasoner rules. We evaluated {TRIC} using an example case of a Course Management System {(CMS).} We used the requirements for the tool to verify the design and implementation. The modeling of requirements in models conforming to the requirements metamodel is supported. The inference of implicit relations and consistency checking of the model is supported. The analysis of implicit relations is supported by a visualization engine. We investigated the scalability of the tool by looking at the time and resource behavior. The time needed for consistency checking increases exponentionally with the number of model elements. The memory consumption seems linear with respect to the model size. {TRIC} does not support multiple metamodels. More research is needed on customizing the requirements metamodel and the formalization of additional relations. The inconsistencies found by the tool are not related to the contradicting requirements relations. {TRIC} supports the modeling and analysis of a requirements model. The next step is to support change impact analysis.},

	abstract = {Model Driven Architecture {(MDA)} is composed of a hierarchy of three levels of models : computation independent model {(CIM)}, platform independent model {(PIM)} and platform specific model {(PSM).} Currently, there exists no formal {CIM} definition describing its structure of elements to which transformation rules can be applied. It is therefore the goal of this paper to attempt such a structure. In our view, the {CIM} can be divided into a hierarchy of three interconnected models: the business motivation model {(BMM)}, the business process model {(BPM)}, and the requirements model {(RM).} This paper presents how these three models can account for the {CIM} and how they are related to each other.},

Implementing a {TFM} Tool is considered to enable fetching a {TFM} from use cases, editing and verifying the {TFM}, and transforming {TFM} to Unified Modeling Language {(UML).} Solution’s compatibility to {MDA} standards is also considered, thus increasing the completeness of {MDA} and providing a formal method to automatically acquire a {CIM} from description of a business system in form of textual use cases.},

It requires the core modeling to be done in the problem space by domain specialists and not in the solution space by technology specialists. {URDAD} allows for formal elements to be added by different role players at different stages of the model refinement, whilst aiming to preserve agility of the outputs and low cost of the process generating the outputs. This paper discusses the semi-formal aspects of {URDAD} which facilitate model validation and testing, documentation generation and automated implementation mapping as well as aspects which promote agility and low cost.},
